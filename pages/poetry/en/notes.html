    notes for an artist’s funeral

    with your eyes blinded, could you tell the difference between the smells of
    a dead cat
    a dead horse
    a dead rat or
    an artist corpse

    …

    could we start to sell the artist body parts as we sell cow meat?

    buy a fresh artist’s ribs and get a original painting that no one cares
    or
    buy the finest filet mignon of the this unknown artist and get their sketchbooks for free

    …

    nowadays everyone is an artist and everyone is dead
    did you bring any flowers?

    …

    the artist was a really nice person but had a horrible taste

    …

    my only doubt is if this funeral is a perfomance or the artist is actually dead.
