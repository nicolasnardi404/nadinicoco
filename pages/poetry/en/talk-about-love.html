    to talk about love 
    or to talk about the many different ways of drinking water from a glass
    how to look at the glass and notice that there is water on it
    how long it takes for the brain to process the image the eyes see
    how many fingers to hold a glass
    the strength
    the movement 
    the muscles required to bring the glass close to the mouth
    the taste of the water
    swallowing
    glass back to the table

    to talk about love
    or to talk about the many different ways to drink water from a glass
    how to look at the person and realize that there is a heart inside
    how long it takes for the brain to process the image the eyes see
    how many fingers to hold a heart
    the strength 
    the movement
    the muscles you need to get close to the heart
    the image of your hands holding a pulsing heart
    the image of your hands holding a fish out of water
    if you don't break a glass while drinking water
    you should not break a heart while holding it
    the taste of love
    swallow
    heart back in the chest

    to talk about love
    or to talk about the many different ways to drink water from a glass
    which glass to choose to pour the water into
    the table where the glass is
    how many people around this table
    how long does it take for the desire to drink water
    to become the actual action of drinking water

    to talk about love
    or to talk about the many different ways to drink water from a glass
    how much love you can pour into a heart before it overflows
    where to do this 
    in a hidden forest with a fireplace or inside a mall during xmas
    is there any need to have an audience
    for drinking water from a glass or for being in love
    how long does it take for the desire to drink water
    become the actual action of being in love

    you drinking water from a glass
    while I hold my heart between my hands on the other side of the table
