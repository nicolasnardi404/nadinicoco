    forget the heart outside the fridge 
    take sometime watching the fresh red color becoming brown
    and the brown becoming shades of pale dark green
    wait for the first worm to appear
    have a look how they build their families
    feeding their babies with rotten heart
    so they can grown strong and healthy
    humans have more to learn by observing worms than by talking with other humans

    have you ever realized how selfish you were with this heart
    allowing just one person in
    and now look at the worms
    a whole new society
    creating new roads, houses, playgrounds
    in the same place where you only allowed your loved one to be
    babys aunties uncles moms and dads worms
    growing in safety and taking care of each other

    forget the heart outside the fridge
    wait for the smells of a rotten broken heart pop up
    and the worms party begins
    full of disgusting and cheerful insects

    forget the heart outside the fridge
    get your best sharpened knife
    cut it into thin layers
    get a pot with hot oil
    and fry it with salt and pepper
    the heart with all the worm families
    poor little things
    that one day believe the heart was a safe place to be
