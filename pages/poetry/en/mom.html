    my dear kid
    tell me
    what are you going to do
    when mom dies
    my god
    holy virgin mary
    where did I go wrong
    this kid
    beautiful beautiful but
    bum
    poor
    artist my kid doesn't make it
    poet doesn't make it
    none of these things provide you money believe in your mother
    what are you going to do
    when I die
    you could be an engineer
    mom's pride
    but literature
    what did mommy teach you honey
    money, money, cash
    these things my son
    don't make fanzines
    who taught you this nonsense
    tell mama
    what you gonna do
    when i die
    - i'm gonna read this poem at the funeral mom
