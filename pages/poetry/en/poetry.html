    poetry
    taking you out of the rubbish bin
    whispering in your earrings
    baby, its all good, you are beautiful 
    but you stinks
    
    poetry
    taking you for a warm shower
    cleaning under your nails
    massaging you with coconut oil
    telling you bedtime stories before you sleep
    
    poetry
    you remind me everything is nice out here
    while you stab a knife on my chest and put me back at the rubbish bin
    
    poetry
    never gonna sort it out anything
    the rubbish bin is still dirty
    but look at my nails now glittering here around all this crap
