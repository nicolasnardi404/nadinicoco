    the war is phallic
    because a competition to see which man has the biggest dick
    would look weird
    they bomb each other 
    the guns
    the dicks
    the phallus
    premature ejaculation
    the obsession with the territory
    because walking around like dogs pissing on trees to mark the land
    would look weird

    the war is phallic
    therapy sessions would be cheaper
    freud kids on power with their mommy issues
    the war never stop
    the guns
    the dicks
    the phallus
    premature ejaculation
    the war is not just the bombs
    the war of colonialism the war against nature
    the monstanto seeds murdering our native seeds
    the war on race the war on gender
    the bombs are not always an explosion
    Its the structure eating the culture of native people
    Its the measures that grief our bodies in different ways
    tiny boxes to make everyone fit in the same rubbish bin

    the war is phallic
    the guns
    the dicks
    the phallus
    premature ejaculation
    oh baby that was amazing
    did you come

    and the winner of the competition of the biggest dick
    is again the patriarchy
    smile
    claps our hands 
    and get your axes ready to chop this dick off
