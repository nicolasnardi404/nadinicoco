    life is a performance

    act one
    a house with three rooms
    the doors are closed
    character one opens the door and appears then character two opens the door and appears then character tree opens the door and appears
    all the characters are the same
    you
    good morning me
    you are the me they are looking at

    act two
    you are in a bar doing a talk show about the many voices in your heads
    the audience is only you
    multiple times

    live is a performance
    an illusion that you exist
    and wear clothes and are always late
    a body holding different puppets
    thinking that there is a main leader in charge
    while the puppets are controlling the body

    how many characters each character has available?
    the character of the character of the character that was me
    is making me coffee right now
    would you like some?

    live is a performance
    the audience is eating popcorn and talking about the increase of rent of last decade
    people paid ten euros for the popcorn but they gonna give you a few 20 cents coins for the show
    the popcorn was at least salty said the the newspaper

    act three*

    *at this time is well know by the audience that we didnâ€™t have any money to buy other bodies to perform with you

    so you set the stage on fire 
    on an experimental breaking the four wall of theatre act
    you do not just burn yourself but the audience with you
    but then you realize that the audience who you are burning is not the same audience eating popcorn
    is only you and you and you and you all over again
    burning yourself the theater the audience that is you and the money people paid for the tickets

    life is a performance
    do you want to play
    now I became a giant mushroom with laser eyes and you became a cyborg tree with five legs and metallic wings
    how do we run from here?

    last act
    you wake up in the morning and there are multiple copies of you in the room
    begging to go to work for you today while you can have an extra nap
    next cut
    a few hours later you wake up with your boss calling you are late for work
