    the machine starts when a new one is born
    the genitals are programmed by our society to function as a stamping machine
    girl girl
    boy boy
    made
    send the next babies

    gender
    the capitalist fairy tale to control our bodies

    bodies
    that exist before patriarchy before capitalism
    bodies that exist outside any strategy of oppression 

    the baby's mind disarmed
    with a brain that is not even a brain
    with a body that is just beginning to grow

    you are your genitalia
    hear the brain before the child's first steps
    you are your genitalia
    hear the brain before the child even begins to speak
    you are your genitals
    hear the brain before the body even realizes what the genitals are

    a body 
    just a body
    not a binary equation
    bodies are more complex than your toy soldiers

    a body that together with another bodies
    be careful
    they can eat you alive
