    jesus fuckin christ
    how many things have been built on your name
    the hymen held by the amen
    the hymen the cis man the amen

    virgin saint mary
    your churches made by miracle of a man
    born from a virgin woman
    the hymen was only broken by jesus
    coming out of mariaâ€™s vulva

    virgin holy mary
    reproducing life from the light
    the pure
    angelical
    saint
    innocent shaved child

    biology or bible
    biology
    the sperm coming out of the penis and going up the vagina
    trying to find an egg to attach to it
    children on the way
    or bible
    the light of the divine entering your body
    while you are sunbathing in ibiza

    protect the girls
    from the perverted lights of the sun
    the virgin mary was a minor 
    when she gave birth to our savior

    hail mary 
    full of grace
    the lord is with thee
    blessed art thou among women
    and blesses is the fruit of thy womb, jesus fuckin christ
    how many things have been built upon his name
    virgins all the virgins
    the hymen was held by the amen
    the hymen was held by men
    The hymen the cis man the amen

    virgins all virgins
    the hymen can only be broken by jesus coming out of your vulva
    amen
