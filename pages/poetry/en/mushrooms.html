    when you die you will grow into a mushroom 
    and someone walking by will find you and pick and eat you
    mushrooms are very tasty, they have protein
    they're good for the human body
    
    mushrooms invented the Internet
    look in wikipedia about the mycelium 
    they have been interconnecting plants for thousands of years
    the wifi of the plants already existed before the fiber optic internet
    that they keep calling me every week to offer a new plan
    of a new internet a little faster than the previous one
    the human being only knows how to copy what nature has done well before
    and then they want to kill all the plants so they can pretend to be the great creator of the universe
    
    the great creator of the universe
    god does not exist
    there is tree
    there is plant
    there is nature
    and the rest are religions trying to personify nature into a false god
    plants are the first religion
    plants are the only religion
    I died and so did you
    let's become mushrooms
    mushrooms can save
    mushrooms can kill 
    mushrooms can heal
    mushrooms can make your whole body collapse
    
    mushrooms will devour your little body
    your pretty eyes
    your soft skin
    
    when you die you will grow into a mushroom 
    and someone walking by will find you and pick and eat you
    mushrooms are very tasty, they have protein
    they're good for the human body
